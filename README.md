#Leap Motion Plugin for ShiVa 3D

##Note on original code
This code is based on a plugin by 8DashP, but does not actually use any original code from it. Furthermore, the plugin uses both the EIGEN library and the LEAP SDK.

##Getting Started
This repository contains plugin source code for the ShiVa 3D game engine, it also contains pre-compiled version of the plugin that allows you to get up and running more quickly.

###Source
The plugin has been compiled with the following tools and components:
* The Leap Motion SDK (2.3.1)
* Visual Studio 2013
* ShiVa 3D 1.9.2
* EIGEN 07105f7124f9

##Adding Leap SDKs
The Leap SDK is not included in this repository. If you want to recompile the plugin, you must copy the SDK into the plugin Sources/leapSDK folder.

##The ShiVa 3D Sample Projects
The included demo game was made with ShiVa 1.9.2 and should work on 2.0 as well.
